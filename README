# javabrowser

A web application to explore the classes that are available on the
application's classpath.

Note: I'm very new to Clojure and am using this project to help me
learn.

## Usage

## Start Compojure Web Server

From Clojure, run `(main)` or from Java, run `startServer()` to start
a webserver on port 9000

## Ruby Serve Project

This is also a Serve project just for convenience of having compass,
sass and haml available. Run `serve` at the command line and then
browse to port 4000.
