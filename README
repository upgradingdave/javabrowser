# javabrowser

A web application to explore the classes that are available to a java
project

If the webapp is started from within a directory that is a maven
project, it will use the pom to find jar dependencies. 

Otherwise, it checks which jars are in the classpath (which really
isn't useful because it will only find jars inside the webapp
classpath)

I'm just learning Clojure, so I'm sure the code is a mess. 

## Usage

## Start Compojure Web Server

    lein ring server

## Ruby Serve Project

This is also a Serve project just for convenience of having compass,
sass and haml available. Run `serve` at the command line and then
browse to port 4000.
